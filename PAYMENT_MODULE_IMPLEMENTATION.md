# Payment Module Implementation Summary

## Overview

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive payment module for the MotorTrace backend that supports both manual payments (for in-person cash transactions) and automated payment gateway integrations (Stripe, PayPal, Razorpay). The module is designed as a modular monolithic architecture that integrates seamlessly with the existing work order system.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Manual Payment Processing
- **Service Advisor Manual Payments**: Service advisors can manually mark payments as paid for in-person cash transactions
- **Multiple Payment Methods**: Support for cash, credit card, debit card, bank transfer, UPI, cheque, digital wallet, insurance, and warranty payments
- **Payment Tracking**: Complete tracking of payment status, amounts, and processing history

### 2. Automated Payment Gateway Integration
- **Payment Intents**: Create payment intents for online payments
- **Webhook Processing**: Automatic payment verification through webhooks
- **Multiple Providers**: Support for Stripe, PayPal, and Razorpay
- **Automatic Status Updates**: Work order payment status automatically updated based on payment processing

### 3. Payment Management
- **Payment Summaries**: Get comprehensive payment summaries for work orders
- **Payment Statistics**: Detailed analytics and reporting
- **Refund Processing**: Support for full and partial refunds
- **Payment History**: Complete audit trail of all payment activities

## Architecture

### Modular Monolithic Design
The payment module follows a modular monolithic architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
src/modules/payments/
├── index.ts                    # Module exports
├── payments.types.ts           # TypeScript interfaces and types
├── payments.validation.ts      # Input validation schemas
├── payments.service.ts         # Business logic layer
├── payments.controller.ts      # HTTP request handling
├── payments.routes.ts          # API route definitions
├── payments.test.ts            # Demo and test examples
├── README.md                   # Module documentation
└── API_DOCUMENTATION.md        # Comprehensive API docs
```

### Infrastructure Layer
```
src/infrastructure/payment/
├── payment.ts                  # Base payment infrastructure
└── stripe-payment.ts          # Stripe integration service
```

## Database Integration

The payment module leverages the existing Prisma schema with the `Payment` model that includes:

- **Payment Records**: Complete payment history with amounts, methods, and status
- **Work Order Integration**: Automatic linking to work orders
- **Service Advisor Tracking**: Records who processed each payment
- **Refund Support**: Full and partial refund tracking
- **Audit Trail**: Complete timestamp and metadata tracking

## API Endpoints

### Core Payment Operations
- `POST /api/payments/payment-intents` - Create payment intent for online payments
- `POST /api/payments/manual` - Create manual payment (cash, check, etc.)
- `POST /api/payments/verify` - Verify payment from gateway
- `GET /api/payments/:paymentId` - Get specific payment
- `PUT /api/payments/:paymentId` - Update payment
- `POST /api/payments/refunds` - Create refund

### Payment Management
- `GET /api/payments` - Get payments with filters
- `GET /api/payments/work-orders/:workOrderId/summary` - Get work order payment summary
- `GET /api/payments/statistics` - Get payment statistics
- `POST /api/payments/:paymentId/mark-as-paid` - Mark payment as paid manually

### Utility Endpoints
- `GET /api/payments/methods` - Get available payment methods
- `GET /api/payments/statuses` - Get available payment statuses

### Webhook Endpoints
- `POST /api/payments/webhooks/stripe` - Stripe webhook processing
- `POST /api/payments/webhooks/paypal` - PayPal webhook processing
- `POST /api/payments/webhooks/razorpay` - Razorpay webhook processing

## Security & Authorization

### Authentication
- All endpoints require valid Supabase authentication token
- Webhook endpoints are public but validate signatures

### Authorization
- **Service Advisor Role**: Required for manual payments, updates, and refunds
- **Manager Role**: Required for payment statistics access
- **Role-based Access Control**: Integrated with existing role system

### Security Features
- Input validation with Joi schemas
- Webhook signature verification
- Payment amount validation against work order estimates
- Refund amount validation
- Complete audit trail

## Integration with Work Orders

The payment module automatically:

1. **Updates Work Order Payment Status**: When payments are processed, the work order's payment status is automatically updated
2. **Uses Estimate Amount**: Payment intents use the work order's estimated total amount
3. **Tracks Payment History**: All payments are linked to work orders for complete audit trails
4. **Calculates Remaining Amount**: Automatically calculates remaining amounts for partial payments

## Payment Flow Examples

### Manual Cash Payment Flow
1. Service advisor creates work order with estimate
2. Customer pays cash in person
3. Service advisor creates manual payment record via API
4. System automatically updates work order payment status
5. Payment is recorded with complete audit trail

### Online Payment Flow
1. Service advisor creates work order with estimate
2. System creates payment intent for online payment
3. Customer completes payment through payment gateway
4. Webhook automatically processes payment confirmation
5. System creates payment record and updates work order status

### Refund Flow
1. Service advisor creates refund request
2. System validates refund amount against original payment
3. Refund is processed and recorded
4. Work order payment status is updated
5. Complete refund history is maintained

## Configuration

The module supports configuration through environment variables:

```env
# Stripe Configuration
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...

# PayPal Configuration
PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=...
PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET=...
PAYPAL_WEBHOOK_ID=...

# Razorpay Configuration
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=...
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=...
RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET=...
```

## Error Handling

The module includes comprehensive error handling:

- **Validation Errors**: Input validation with detailed error messages
- **Business Logic Errors**: Proper error handling for business rules
- **Database Errors**: Graceful handling of database operations
- **Payment Gateway Errors**: Error handling for external payment provider issues

## Testing & Documentation

### Documentation
- **README.md**: Module overview and usage guide
- **API_DOCUMENTATION.md**: Comprehensive API documentation with examples
- **Inline Comments**: Detailed code documentation

### Testing
- **Demo File**: `payments.test.ts` with usage examples
- **Validation**: Comprehensive input validation
- **Error Scenarios**: Proper error handling and testing

## Deployment Integration

The payment module is integrated into the main application:

1. **Routes Registered**: Payment routes are registered in `src/app.ts`
2. **Middleware Applied**: Authentication and authorization middleware applied
3. **Database Ready**: Uses existing Prisma schema
4. **Environment Ready**: Configured for different environments

## Future Enhancements

The modular design allows for easy future enhancements:

1. **Additional Payment Gateways**: Easy to add new payment providers
2. **Advanced Analytics**: Enhanced reporting and analytics
3. **Payment Scheduling**: Recurring payment support
4. **Multi-currency Support**: International payment support
5. **Payment Plans**: Installment payment support

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Manual Cash Payment
```typescript
const paymentData = {
  workOrderId: "work-order-id-123",
  method: "CASH",
  amount: 150.00,
  reference: "CASH-001",
  notes: "Customer paid in cash",
  processedById: "service-advisor-id-456"
};

const response = await fetch('/api/payments/manual', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(paymentData)
});
```

### Getting Work Order Payment Summary
```typescript
const response = await fetch('/api/payments/work-orders/work-order-id-123/summary', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
  }
});

const summary = await response.json();
console.log(`Total Amount: $${summary.data.totalAmount}`);
console.log(`Paid Amount: $${summary.data.paidAmount}`);
console.log(`Remaining: $${summary.data.remainingAmount}`);
```
