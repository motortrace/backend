# Test Plan: MotorTrace Backend System
## Solo Tester Edition

## 1. Introduction

The MotorTrace Backend is a comprehensive vehicle service management system designed to streamline operations across automotive service centers. The system manages user authentication, service center operations, inventory tracking, appointment scheduling, administrative functions, and algorithm-based service suggestions for particular cars through a RESTful API architecture with monolithic architecture for the system backend.

This test plan outlines the testing strategy for ensuring the backend system meets all functional, security, and performance requirements while maintaining data integrity and proper role-based access controls.

**System Overview:**
- Monolithic architecture supporting various service centers
- Role-based access control (Admin, Inventory Manager, Service Adviser, Technician, and Customers)
- Real-time inventory management
- Appointment and service scheduling
- Financial tracking and reporting
- Algorithm-based service suggestions

**Solo Tester Context:**
This test plan is designed for a single person handling all testing responsibilities, with practical time management and prioritization strategies.
